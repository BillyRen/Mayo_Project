Dear Dr. Jonnalagadda,

Here's my Project Report.

##STUDY
1.	Entrez Programming Utilities Study
	+	Read the Quick Start Guide of E-utilities
	+	E-utilities is url-based tools, so I think it's very easy to be intergrated into Python or Java Prgrams
2.	Study LDA
3.	Study tag-based recommendation system
	+	Do a detailed study on gragh agorithm based on random walk

##RESEARCH
1.	Baidu.com (Like Google in China) has released an inteligent clinical answering system in China. I did a detaild research on this system.
	+	The system is based on the data of Baidu Wiki(Wikipedia in China) and Baidu Zhidao(Quora in China)
	+	Once you search "cold", baidu will provide more detailed subchoice, such as: hava a fever, cough, nasal obstruction.
	+	User can choose different situations and Baidu will finally give most related answer
	+	I think this system is quite similar with ours, maybe we can did a more detailed researh on its method

Best wishes,
