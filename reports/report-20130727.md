Dear Dr. Jonnalagadda,

Here's my Project Report for last week.

##PREPARATION
1.	Made a Trello Board for this project
2.	Setup resource and code sharing system via Google Drive and GitHub

##LITERETURE STUDY
1.	Read your recently published paper that you sent me on last meeting
2.	Did a research on text cluster and keyword extraction 

##OTHER STUDY
1.	Standford parser had a recently update in last month

	+	It seemed to be more deep-learning-friendly
	+	I'm not quite sure whether this will help our project

##NEXT WEEK'S PLAN
1.	To have a discussion about what I can do in this project
2.	Keep learning some text-mining knowledge

Best wishes,

Billy
